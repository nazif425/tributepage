			<p>
				Carl Gustav Jung was born on July 26, 1875, in Kesswil, Switzerland to father Johann Paul Achilles Jung, a clergyman, and mother Emilie Preiswerk Jung.
				When Jung initially studied Medicine at the University of Basel in 1895, he had no plans to study psychiatry.  During this period of time it was held in content, but once Jung read that psychoses are personality diseases, he became very excited in the field. This combination of both biological and spiritual facts greatly interested Jung. In 1900, at the age of 25, he began his work as First Assistant Physician at the Burgholzli Psychiatric Clinic in Zurich, under Eugen Bleuler. During this period, he completed his dissertation, which went on to be published in 1903, titled “On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena.”

				<strong>Quotes by Carl Jung</strong>
			</div> 
			<ul>
				<li>
					Loneliness does not come from having no people around you, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to you.
				</li>
				<li>
					To be normal is the ultimate aim of the unsuccessful.
The first half of life is devoted to forming a healthy ego, the second half is going inward and letting go of it.
				</li>
				<li>
					If our religion is based on salvation, our chief emotions will be fear and trembling. If our religion is based on wonder, our chief emotion will be gratitude.
				</li>
				<li>
					What usually has the strongest psychic effect on the child is the life which the parents have not lived.
				</li>
				<li>					
					There is no coming to consciousness without pain. People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own soul. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.
				</li>
				<li>
					A man who is unconscious of himself acts in a blind, Instinctive way, and is, in addition, fooled by all the illusions that arise when he sees everything that he is not conscious of in himself coming to meet him from outside as projections upon his neighbor.
				</li>
				<li>
					The artist is not a person endowed with free will, who seeks his own ends, but one who allows art to realize its purposes through him. As a human being, he may have moods, and a will, and personal aims, but as an artist, he is “man” in a higher sense: He is “collective man,” a vehicle and molder of the unconscious psychic life of mankind.
				</li>
				<li>
					I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.
				</li>
